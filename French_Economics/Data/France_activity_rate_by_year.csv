#In 1962, INSEE reports that 69% of 15–64-year-olds were in the labour force (recensement). Since 15–19 and 60–64 have much lower participation than 20–60, the same year’s 20–60 rate would be a few points higher—roughly ~72%#1975: ~73–76%. Prime-age activity was very high for men but much lower for women (25–49: men ≈97%, women ≈61%), pulling the combined 20–60 rate into the mid-70s. 
#INSEE also notes that in 1962 only 40–45% of women aged 30–50 were active (men near 95% at those ages), which is consistent with a combined 20–60 LFPR in the low 70s.
#1990: ~77–80%. Women’s participation rose; youth and early seniors were still comparatively less active. (Use INSEE “séries longues” to pin the exact mix.) 
#2000: ~79–82%. Continued rise in women; seniors just starting to pick up. 
#2010: ~81–83%. Stronger participation for 50–59; overall 15–64 activity hovered around low-70s then. 
#2024: ~82–84%. Using INSEE 2024 activity: 20–24 ≈42.3%, 25–49 ≈88.6%, 50–64 ≈72.0%; weighting toward 20–60 (so a bit higher than 50–64, a bit lower than 25–49) lands in the low-/mid-80s.
