""" This file allows to test the calculations done after creating the quantum circuit
It implements the continued fractions to find a possible r and then:
    If r found is odd, tries next approximation of the continued fractions method
    If r found is even, tries to get the factors of N and then:
        If the factors are found, exits
        If the factors are not found, asks user if he wants to continue looking (only if already tried too many times it exits automatically)
