# Understanding entropy and the second law of thermodynamics

This repository contains the code supporting the medium articles:

- [It took me 10 years to understand entropy, here is what I learned.](https://aurelien-pelissier.medium.com/rewinding-the-universe-to-the-beginning-of-time-b98c82e6a606)  
- [On the conservation of information and the second law of thermodynamics](https://aurelien-pelissier.medium.com/the-timeline-of-our-universe-7fd01d8ee221)

To reproduce the entropy calculation presented in the article, you can run the python scripts `Entropy_simulation_time_evolution.py` and `Entropy_simulation_Coarsegraining.py`
